# kibana-plugins

A suite of Kibana Plugins

To run these plugins against the latest version of Kibana, have the Kibana Repo
checked out locally and ready for development by following the
[Contributing guide](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

To keep the plugins synced with your Kibana development dir:

-  Install gulp

```
npm install gulp -g
```

- Copy `config.yml` to `config.dev.yml` and set kibana.dir

- Run:

```
gulp 
```

- Develop in the `${kibana.dir}/plugin` to get typescript and imports to resolve correctly, the
  changes will be copied back over into this dir.
