# Greeting card application

This plugin serves as a simple example of a Kibana plugin. It's also part of a larger story,

There are some anti-patterns used in this plugin, on purpose.

Specifically, the greeting card types are hard coded.

Check out [Greeting cards v2](../greeting_cards_v2) to see an improved iteration and learn when
it's useful to create a registry.
